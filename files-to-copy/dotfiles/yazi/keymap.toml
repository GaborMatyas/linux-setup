# Yazi keymap configuration
# This file customizes key bindings for Yazi file manager

[manager]
# Keep default keybindings and add custom ones here
# Zoxide integration is handled by Yazi's built-in support
# The "No directory history found" message is just informational
# As you navigate with cd/z in your terminal, zoxide will learn your patterns

# You can add custom keybindings here, for example:
# prepend_keymap = [
#   { on = [ "g", "h" ], run = "cd ~", desc = "Go to home" },
#   { on = [ "g", "c" ], run = "cd ~/.config", desc = "Go to config" },
# ]
